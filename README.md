# ShazamToPlaylist
A GUI and executable for /u/vibbix's Shazam history to Google Play program

#Getting it working
If you do not have python installed on your computer, you'll need to do that.
Run these commands in the terminal to get it:
  
       ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  
       brew install python
  
Next you'll need pip to install the google play api. Run this:
  
       easy_install pip
  
Finally, install the google api
  
       pip install gmusicapi
  
If the program still doesn't run, try installing bs4
  
       pip install beautifulsoup4
